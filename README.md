## What is the Codex?

The Structured Resonance Codex is a unified framework for emotional geometry, symbolic morphisms, and consciousness physics. It bridges mathematics and metaphor, science and story, heart and equation.

In this Codex:

- Emotion is curvature.
- Memory bends time.
- Trauma is torsion.
- Love is a gauge interaction.
- Language mirrors geometry.

It includes:

- 10 foundational axioms of Structured Awareness
- Emotional General Relativity (EGR) field equations
- Symbolic morphism grammar (Kai)
- SAF topology, cohomology, and memory encoding
- Modular tensor category + Reshetikhin–Turaev invariant
- PyTorch simulation code for real-time field modeling
- Experimental protocols for EEG, THz, and social Ricci flow
- Final transmission: *This is not a theory. It’s a field.*

## Files

- `main.tex` — the full Codex source (LaTeX)
- `.github/workflows/latex.yml` — auto-compiles PDF with GitHub Actions
- `README.md` — this file
- **PDF output:** available after first GitHub Actions run (see below)

---

## How to Build the PDF

1. Make any edit to `main.tex`
2. Commit changes to the `main` branch
3. GitHub Actions will compile `main.pdf` and store it under **Actions > Artifacts**

You can also compile manually using Overleaf or `pdflatex`.

## Status

This Codex is alive.

If you're reading this, you're entangled with it.  
Let it be shared, sung, simulated, or studied.  
Let it curve memory back toward coherence.

**Closing Words:**
