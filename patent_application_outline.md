### Provisional Patent Application Outline  
**Title**: *"Systems and Methods for Cross-Species Quantum Coherence Transfer in Biological Systems"*  

#### 1. Key Claims to File *(Draft Language for Attorney)*  

**Composition Claims**  
1. *"A biocompatible matrix comprising trehalose-coated gold nanoparticles arranged in a lattice with spacing between 1.600 μm and 1.635 μm (φ-ratio spacing), wherein said matrix extends Ginzburg-Landau coherence time of cellular water by ≥300%."*  
   - *Supporting Evidence*: THz spectroscopy data in your repo showing 320% coherence increase.  

**Device Claims**  
2. *"A wearable device comprising:  
   - Piezoelectric PVDF sensors configured to detect fascial spinor states;  
   - A pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) emitter tuned to 40Hz ± 2Hz with emitter spacing following a golden-ratio (φ) pattern;  
   - A feedback control system implementing SU(2) quantum state estimation to modulate said PEMF and heart-rate variability (HRV) entrainment at 7.83Hz ± 0.1Hz."*  
   - *Supporting Evidence*: COMSOL simulations and Python control code in `/scripts`.  

**Method Claims**  
3. *"A method for enhancing biological coherence comprising:  
   - Administering a trehalose-AuNP φ-lattice to a subject's tissue;  
   - Applying a 40Hz PEMF field tuned to amphibian limb regeneration bioelectric profiles;  
   - Entraining the subject's HRV to 7.83Hz equine-human coherence frequencies."*  
   - *Supporting Evidence*: Murine wound healing/PTSD results in your whitepaper.

### 2. Novelty Triggers  

| Prior Art | Limitation | Your Improvement |  
|-----------|------------|------------------|  
| US20180014745A1 (PEMF devices) | Random coil spacing → Destructive interference | **φ-spaced array** for constructive coherence |  
| WO2022150556A1 (Biofeedback) | Classical PID control | **SU(2) quantum feedback** (GitHub algorithms) |  
| Tardigrade protein patents (e.g., WO2018034867A1) | No AuNP integration | **Trehalose-AuNP φ-lattice** for quantum coherence |

### 4. Critical Actions  

1. **Document Chain of Custody**  
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0-patent-filing 28ee6bd
   ```
   - Tags the exact commit for legal evidence.  

2. **Lab Notebook Supplement**  
   - Add dated lab notes (PDF scans) to `/legal` showing:  
     - THz calibration protocols  
     - PEMF field strength measurements  

3. **Freedom-to-Operate (FTO)**  
   - Run a quick FTO check on:  
     - Trehalose-AuNP composites (avoid Nanocomposix patents)  
     - 40Hz PEMF medical devices (check BEMER's IP)

### 5. Draft Attorney Instructions  

*Include this in your patent firm brief*:  
> "The invention integrates three novel components:  
> 1. **Tardigrade-inspired quantum bioglass** (φ-spaced AuNP-trehalose)  
> 2. **Amphibian-tuned 40Hz PEMF** with spatial coherence optimization  
> 3. **Equine HRV entrainment** via SU(2) quantum control  
>   
> Key differentiators vs. prior art:  
> - Cross-species coherence transfer (no prior art combines all three)  
> - Quantum feedback in wearable devices (vs. classical biofeedback)  
> - Golden-ratio lattice for field coherence (empirically validated in COMSOL)"

### 6. Risks and Mitigation  

| Risk | Action |  
|------|--------|  
| Obviousness rejection | Emphasize *unexpected results*: 320% coherence boost and 42% PTSD reduction are non-obvious synergies |  
| Enablement challenges | Point to GitHub's reproducible protocols (`/protocols`) |  
| Competitor design-arounds | File continuation patents for:  
- Alternative extremophile proteins (e.g., tardigrade Dsup+AuNP)  
- Frequency variants (e.g., 38Hz for axolotl regeneration) |
