\section*{Abstract}
An emotional biometric cryptographic key system is disclosed, which dynamically generates and manages encryption keys based on a user’s physiological and emotional coherence. Multi-modal biometric inputs, including electroencephalogram (EEG) brainwave synchrony and heart rate variability (HRV) coherence, are fused to produce a cryptographic key when the user’s mind-heart state is coherent. The keys are inherently ephemeral and collapse (become invalid) upon detecting emotional trauma or loss of coherence, as indicated by a sudden increase in an emotional turbulence metric (e.g., curl of an emotional field exceeding a threshold). A symbolic artificial intelligence (AI) context engine provides a semantic emotional embedding $h(t)$ that modulates key generation parameters and validity duration based on the user’s emotional context. In one embodiment, the system (branded COHERENCE\textsuperscript{\texttrademark}) enforces “ephemeral identity,” meaning authentication persists only while emotional synchrony is maintained. Optionally, the cryptographic keys may control quantum cryptographic processes, including biologically entangled quantum gates, to further bind the key to the user’s physiological state. This Continuation-in-Part improves upon prior EEG-based key methods by introducing multi-modal resonance inputs, trauma-triggered key revocation, semantic context awareness, and quantum coupling for enhanced security and ethical, consent-based access control.

\section*{Claims}
\begin{enumerate}
\item A method for generating and managing a cryptographic key based on emotional biometric coherence, comprising:
\begin{itemize}
  \item acquiring EEG brainwave signals and HRV signals from a user;
  \item computing a coherence value representing real-time synchrony;
  \item generating a cryptographic key from a fusion of EEG and HRV data when coherence exceeds a threshold;
  \item monitoring for trauma indicators based on curl$(\mathcal{E}) > \epsilon$;
  \item invalidating the key if trauma or incoherence is detected;
  \item wherein the key is ephemeral and only valid during continuous physiological coherence.
\end{itemize}
\item The method of claim 1, further comprising modulation by a symbolic emotional context signal $h(t)$.
\item The method of claim 2, wherein $h(t)$ is derived from a symbolic AI model, and modifies $\lambda$ or key duration.
\item The method of claim 1, wherein key generation comprises:
\begin{itemize}
  \item computing $K = H(\text{HRV}_{\text{sync}} \oplus \nabla \mathcal{E})$.
\end{itemize}
\item The method of claim 1, wherein trauma is detected via changes in HRV, EEG, or symbolic context.
\item The method of claim 1, wherein the key governs authentication for a secure system, and session collapses upon loss of coherence.
\item A system implementing the above method, comprising:
\begin{itemize}
  \item biometric sensors (EEG, HRV);
  \item a processor computing coherence;
  \item symbolic AI engine for $h(t)$;
  \item key management system enforcing collapse.
\end{itemize}
\item The system of claim 7, wherein coherence thresholds, time-to-live, or trauma sensitivity are adjusted by $h(t)$.
\item The system of claim 7, further comprising a quantum subsystem, wherein biometric coherence sustains quantum entanglement.
\item The system of claim 9, wherein EPS-QC coupling collapses quantum keys upon emotional incoherence.
