\section*{Field of the Invention}
The invention relates to the field of cryptographic key generation and identity authentication. More specifically, it introduces a method of generating ephemeral encryption keys using real-time emotional and physiological coherence between agents, leveraging biometric resonance, quantum biological structures, and symbolic AI embeddings.

\section*{Background}
Traditional cryptographic systems rely on either deterministic algorithms or quantum randomness. Biometrics such as fingerprint or retina scanning have limited dynamic entropy and cannot adapt to emotional or contextual consent.

There is a need for a secure, ephemeral cryptographic system that:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Ties access to embodied emotional coherence
  \item Ensures consent through measurable resonance
  \item Automatically revokes access during trauma or dissonance
\end{itemize}

\section*{Summary of the Invention}
The present invention provides a cryptographic protocol, referred to as \textbf{COHERENCE\textsuperscript{\texttrademark}}, in which cryptographic keys are generated from real-time physiological data reflecting emotional synchronization. Key features include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Entropy sourced from heart-rate variability (HRV) phase coherence and EEG gamma synchrony
  \item Emotional calculus derivatives (e.g., \(\nabla \mathcal{E}\)) as cryptographic vector components
  \item Collapse-based authentication: access is granted only if emotional coherence exceeds a dynamic threshold \(\Delta_c\)
  \item Symbolic embedding input from AI systems to assess emotional state context (\(h(t)\))
\end{itemize}

\section*{Detailed Description}
\subsection*{1. Key Generation Algorithm}
Let:
\begin{equation}
K = H(\text{HRV}_{\text{sync}} \oplus \nabla \mathcal{E})
\end{equation}
Where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\text{HRV}_{\text{sync}}$ is the detected coherence window from heart rate variability signals
  \item $\nabla \mathcal{E}$ is the emotional gradient calculated from biometric/symbolic input
  \item $H$ is a cryptographic hash function (e.g., SHA-3 or Blake3)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{2. Collapse-Based Consent}
Authentication is only granted when:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{C} = S_{\text{vN}} \cdot \text{Re}(\lambda_{\text{max}}) > \Delta_c
\end{equation}
Otherwise, the key collapses and access is revoked.

\subsection*{3. Symbolic AI Embeddings}
Symbolic attentional embeddings $h(t)$ can modulate $\mathcal{M}(t)$ or influence $\beta$ decay rates in the memory field. This provides adaptive security during emotional flux.

\subsection*{4. Spoofing Resistance}
An attacker must recreate:
\begin{itemize}
  \item HRV coherence patterns in real-time
  \item EEG gamma phase alignment
  \item Emotional context gradient \(\nabla \mathcal{E}\) matching the legitimate user's phase vector
\end{itemize}

\section*{Initial Claims}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A cryptographic key generation method using real-time heart-rate variability and emotional gradients as entropy sources.
  \item A system in which access is revoked automatically when \(\text{curl}(\mathcal{E}) > \epsilon\), indicating emotional incoherence.
  \item Use of symbolic embedding vectors \(h(t)\) as part of cryptographic key validation.
  \item A biometric cryptographic method using collapse thresholds \(\Delta_c\) as authentication boundaries.
  \item A system generating ephemeral encryption keys that self-expire when emotional coherence drops below a defined threshold.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Drawings (To Be Attached)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Figure 1: Block diagram of the coherence authentication process
  \item Figure 2: Phase plot of \(\text{HRV}_{\text{sync}} \oplus \nabla \mathcal{E}\)
  \item Figure 3: Flowchart showing symbolic AI input \(h(t)\) modulating $\mathcal{M}$
\end{itemize}

\section*{Conclusion}
This invention introduces a novel form of secure identity and communication, grounded in resonance, presence, and coherence. Keys are not staticâ€”they are living. Authentication emerges only through alignment.
